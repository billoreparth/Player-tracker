# Football Player and Ball Tracker 

This project uses a fine-tuned Torch model for real-time detection and tracking of football players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball in match footage. Each player is assigned a unique ID and tracked throughout the video using ByteTrack, ensuring consistent identification even when players leave and re-enter the frame. The ball's position is tracked separately to analyze game dynamics. The system enables detailed analysis by distinguishing between referees, goalkeepers, and outfield players.
